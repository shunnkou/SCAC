# Biomedical research, or experimental medicine, is a combination of basic and applied research done in the interest of promoting a healthy population.

The World Health Organization’s (WHO) definition, issued in 1946, implied a normative connotation when describing “healthy” as a “state of complete physical, mental, and social well being” ([WHO, 1946](http://www.who.int/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf)). Later definitions continued to reference “the absence of disease or infirmity” as an indicator of a healthy state, thereby relegating people living with disease and disability to an “unhealthy” category. Using these definitions, one can only be part of a healthy population if their disease/disability is treated, or cured, which first requires diagnosis.

Thus, an individual’s health is assessed using diagnostic tests that measure physical and cognitive abilities in a changing environment and comparing these results to a reference standard. When reduced ability, or disease, emerges, researchers use these cases as opportunities to investigate possible causes. The approach can be medical, seeking to understand, or address, the molecular processes that contribute to disease or disability. Alternatively, the approach can be social, investigating how our current and future environments are hindering some persons from contributing to society and living a full life, without social barriers. In some cases, the social model attempts to address the oppression felt by those living with impairment as a result of discriminatory practices ([Shakespeare, 2002](https://www.um.es/discatif/PROYECTO_DISCATIF/Textos_discapacidad/00_Shakespeare2.pdf)). A contemporary approach looks at the intersection of the biomedical and social models of health by investigating how social factors such as stress, poverty, and racism hijack molecular processes resulting in chronic disease/disability and increased mortality ([Eisenberg, 1999](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455991/); [Galea et al., 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134519/); [Radley et al., 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3641164/)).

Combining biomedical and social approaches to health aids in our understanding of disease, informs practices that prevent their occurrence, and addresses social discrimination associated with disability. Some of the earliest leaders of social medicine include Rudolph Virchow, an important figure in the history of cell biology, and Louis Pasteur, a pioneer in microbiology and communicable disease prevention ([Pridan, 1964](https://www.microbemagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2050:pasteurkoch-distinctive-ways-of-thinking-about-infectious-diseases&catid=502&Itemid=657); [Ullman, 2007](https://www.microbemagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2050:pasteurkoch-distinctive-ways-of-thinking-about-infectious-diseases&catid=502&Itemid=657)). Health policies associated with prevention of disease and disability include air pollution standards, laws regarding occupational workplace safety, guidelines for nutrition and exercise, and mass screenings using diagnostic medical tests. A socio-biomedical approach can also ameliorate the negative effects of living with disease and disability through the development of biomedical therapies, assisted devices/technologies, and the creation of inclusive environments that accommodate variance in ability such as the installation of ramps and the incorporation of sign language. A healthy individual is then defined as one that has the “ability to adapt” to a changing environment, and a healthy environment is one designed to support the life activities of individuals with a diverse range of abilities. This history and approach is succinctly summarized in the Lancet editorial titled “What is health;The ability to adapt” ([Anonymous, 2009](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673609604566/fulltext?rss=yes)).

The field of epigenetics bridges the medical and the social models of health by clarifying the molecular mechanisms involved in responding to the macro-scale environment in which we live ([Bronfenbrenner, 1979](http://books.google.com/books/about/THE_ECOLOGY_OF_HUMAN_DEVELOPMENT.html?id=OCmbzWka6xUC); [Kubicek & Tolpa Studios, 2011](http://images.the-scientist.com/content/images/articles/58007/epigenetics_primer.jpg); *[Slide 3: Bioecological Model](http://stemcellcurriculum.org/slidesets.html))*.

Epigenetics also investigates local micro- environmental effects on cells, tissues, and organs, to determine which environmental signals are responsible for influencing cells to divide, differentiate, move, or die ([Powell, 2005](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7040/full/435268a.html)) (*[Slide 4: Cell Signaling and Cell Fate](http://stemcellcurriculum.org/slidesets.html)*).

Examples of the vital role that environmental factors have in human development include maternal factors in the womb that influence the developing embryo (Slide 5 & 6: Embryonic Development),  extracellular matrix (ECM) components responsible for wound repair (Slide 7 & 8: ECM and Making Body Parts) metabolic by-products that alter gene expression, and bacteria and viruses that live on, and in, our bodies influencing our physiology ([Fountain, 2012](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/health/research/human-muscle-regenerated-with-animal-help.html?src=recg)). This natural process of DNA reprogramming is what allows different cells in our body to possess the same genome but behave and act differently, depending on which regions of the genome are programmed to be active.

Additionally, living organisms have evolved to react to stress by reprogramming their DNA and changing their gene expression. Stressors can take the form of dehydration, malnutrition, or infection. Stress can also be the by-product of social interactions that make a person feel threatened, such as situations involving discrimination ([Radley et al., 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3641164/); [Cossins, 2015](https://www.the-scientist.com/features/stress-fractures-36158); [Seppa, 2015](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chronic-stress-can-wreak-havoc-body)).

# Though epigenetics has regained popularity in the scientific community, the concept has been intimately tied to the study of cancer for some time.

Early studies in the 1950s sought to determine whether our genetic material or environment was responsible for the onset of cancer. Researchers quickly realized that this was not an “either/or” proposition and that gene-environment interactions are responsible for 90% of cancers. These same interactions prove important for understanding tissue regeneration in the context of injury and aging. There are also cases of individuals who have managed to halt some aging processes all together. The bodies, genes, and physiology of these individuals present researchers with an opportunity to identify genetic variations that might contribute to this unusual state, as well as illuminate which molecular processes are involved with regeneration and cancer.

Much of the early work on cancer was dependent on tissue samples and cell cultures established from clinical biopsies, collected without consent for research, thereby circumventing conversations about privacy, ownership, and compensation. In the post-WWII fervor to bring science into the open, attention was shifted from the Big Science Physics of the Manhattan Project to Big Science Biology supporting medical research.
