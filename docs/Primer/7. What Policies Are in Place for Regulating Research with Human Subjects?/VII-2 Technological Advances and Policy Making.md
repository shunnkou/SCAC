In many countries, the interpretation of human subject ethics in the context of generating national biobanks presents new challenges.

Iceland’s deCode, a company purchased by Amgen, has come under fire for a study that seeks to triangulate data from human research volunteers, genomic databases, and family members’ medical records. This is the second time that Kari Stefansson, founder of deCode, has run into problems when creating a “work-around” for informed consent as it relates to population studies. The Icelandic Data Protection Agency (DPA), ruled that the company must first obtain informed consent from each individual to be studied, and that health records can be not be treated as publicly available information (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Kasier, 2013</mark>).

In the US, the 2010 Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act implemented a policy to increase cord blood banking. This policy was in response to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that highlighted the lack of diversity in public cord blood banks. Cord blood has in recent years become the preferred source of blood stem cells that are used during transplant therapies for blood-related disorders, due to its less immunogenic properties and less invasive collection method as compared to either blood stem cells collected from bone marrow or the peripheral blood supply. Despite efforts to increase awareness around donations post-birth, 97% of all cord blood is discarded as medical waste, with the majority of donations occurring in the private cord blood banking sector. Reasons for the low donation rate include general mistrust of the biomedical community, concerns regarding identity and privacy associated with the samples, and resistance to the creation of marketable goods that may subsequently be inaccessible for the donor (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Mohapatra, 2013</mark>).
